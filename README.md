# One_shot_learning
I have taken a dataset containing 373 images of 40 persons, 10 images each for 37 people and 1 image each for the remaining 3. Implemented Siamese network in PyTorch input of Siamese network is 2 images and output is 2 vectors distance between these vectors shows the similarity between images.
Created a support set containing one image from each class and test image is compared with all images in support set and its most similar image is shown in the output.
